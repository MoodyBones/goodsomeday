# Glossary

Terms used across the Oolong + Steep project. Written in plain language. Could serve as public help/FAQ content in the future.

---

**Agreement Bias** — The tendency for AI to agree with you rather than challenge you. The technical term is "sycophancy." The result: you get confident-sounding output that tells you what you want to hear, not what you need to know. See: *Politeness Trap*.

**Grounded** — Tied to real evidence. A grounded claim references a specific project, metric, or outcome. The opposite is vague language like "passionate problem-solver" that could describe anyone.

**Hedging** — Softening a statement to avoid commitment. Words like "perhaps," "maybe," "I think," "just." Often used unconsciously to sound less threatening. In AI output, hedging is a sign the system is optimising for politeness over accuracy.

**Motivational Interviewing (MI)** — A way of having a conversation that helps someone find their own motivation. The core moves: ask open questions, affirm what they say, reflect it back, summarise. Used in the Oolong story submission flow. The coach doesn't tell you what to write - it helps you find it.

**OARS** — The four techniques of motivational interviewing: Open questions, Affirmations, Reflections, Summaries.

**Performative Language** — Words that perform a role rather than communicate meaning. "Thrilled to announce," "passionate about," "excited to share." Signals enthusiasm without containing information.

**Pipeline Stage** — Where someone was in their career when they hit a barrier. Student (education), Early Career (0-5 years), Mid-Career (5+ years).

**Politeness Trap** — When AI gives you agreeable, encouraging responses instead of useful ones. The technical name is *agreement bias*. The trap: you feel good about the output, so you don't question it. The result: mediocre, generic content that sounds like everyone else.

**Socratic Questioning** — Asking questions that help someone think through a problem themselves, rather than giving them the answer. Named after Socrates. Used in the Oolong help system when a user gets stuck writing their story.

**Terroir** — Borrowed from winemaking. The specific conditions (place, climate, soil) that make a wine taste the way it does. In career terms: the specific markets, cultures, and environments you've worked in that shape how you think and operate. Your professional terroir is a differentiator, not a footnote.

**Two-Agent Arc** — The technical architecture behind Steep. Two AI agents working in sequence: the first extracts raw facts from your experience, the second structures them into a grounded profile. Neither agent is allowed to add fluff.
