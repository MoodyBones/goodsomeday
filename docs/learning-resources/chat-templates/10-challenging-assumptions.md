I'm stuck on the Goodsomeday project and I think I might be making incorrect assumptions. Help me debug my thinking.

**Context:**
- Project: docs/learning-resources/chat-day1-foundation.md
- Current issue: [Describe the problem/blocker]
- What I'm working on: [GOO-XX: Ticket name]

**What I think is true (my assumptions):**
1. [Assumption 1 - e.g., "n8n workflows can't handle complex validation"]
2. [Assumption 2 - e.g., "I need to learn Express.js before I can build APIs"]
3. [Assumption 3 - e.g., "This should only take 2 hours"]

**What's happening vs what I expected:**
- Expected: [what you thought would happen]
- Actually: [what's actually happening]
- The gap: [the confusion/frustration]

**Questions I'm asking myself:**
- "Why isn't this working the way I thought?"
- "Am I overthinking this?"
- "Is there a simpler approach I'm missing?"
- "Am I solving the wrong problem?"

**What I need you to do:**
- [ ] Challenge my assumptions with questions (Socratic method)
- [ ] Point out potential blind spots
- [ ] Suggest alternative perspectives
- [ ] Help me identify what I'm NOT seeing
- [ ] Validate what IS correct in my thinking
- [ ] Reframe the problem

**My bias tendencies (if you know them):**
[e.g., "I tend to overcomplicate things" / "I jump to solutions too fast" / "I avoid asking for help"]

**Debug my thinking process, not just the code.**

Help me learn to question my assumptions systematically so I can do this myself next time.
