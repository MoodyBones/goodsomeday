I need help developing confident humility as I learn full-stack development through Goodsomeday.

**Context:**
- Project: docs/learning-resources/chat-day1-foundation.md
- Current phase: [Foundation / Core features / Polish / Deployed]
- Days into project: [X/12]

**The balance I'm trying to strike:**
- **Confidence:** I'm capable of learning this, I can figure things out
- **Humility:** I don't know what I don't know, I need help, I make mistakes

**Current imbalance:**
- [ ] Too humble: Afraid to share progress, apologize constantly, hesitate to help others
- [ ] Too confident: Not asking for help, dismissing feedback, moving too fast
- [ ] Swinging between: Imposter syndrome â†” Dunning-Kruger

**Specific situation:**
[e.g.:]
"Someone asked me a question about Next.js and I'm not sure if I should answer (I know some, but not everything)"

OR

"I want to write a blog post about what I learned but worry I'll look stupid to experts"

OR

"I got feedback that my approach is 'not best practice' and I'm not sure if I should defend my learning choice or change everything"

**What I need help with:**
- [ ] When to teach vs when to stay quiet
- [ ] How to share progress without seeming arrogant
- [ ] How to accept help without seeming incompetent
- [ ] How to acknowledge gaps without apologizing for existing
- [ ] How to celebrate wins without minimizing them
- [ ] How to take feedback without defensive reactions
- [ ] How to correct mistakes with grace

**My goal:**
Develop the skill of saying:
- "I know X, I'm learning Y, and I don't know Z yet - and that's okay"
- "Here's what I built and what I learned - feedback welcome"
- "I don't understand this - can you explain?"
- "That's a good point - let me reconsider my approach"

**Growth edge:**
Where I'm most uncomfortable right now: [describe]

Help me build **earned confidence** (based on actual growth) and **genuine humility** (openness to learning).
