# Daily Activation Prompt: From Values to Action

## Morning Ritual (5-10 minutes)

Find a quiet moment. Take three deep breaths. Read these questions slowly, letting each one settle before moving to the next. Write or speak your answers - whatever feels right today.

---

### Part 1: Connecting to What Matters (Values Anchor)

**"What part of this project actually lights me up?"**

*Not what should light you up. What genuinely does. Maybe it's:*
- The visual design work?
- Helping other learners?
- The feeling of understanding something new?
- Building something accessible?
- The fairness and equality aspect?
- Something else entirely?

*Sit with this. What emotion comes up when you name this?*

---

**"If I imagine someone discovering Goodsomeday and it genuinely helps them - what part of their experience would make me feel 'yes, this is why'?"**

*Connect to the human impact, not the technical achievement.*

---

**"What value am I honouring by working on this today?"**

*Is it:*
- Fairness (building transparent systems)
- Growth (expanding your capabilities)
- Creativity (making beautiful things)
- Service (helping others navigate careers)
- Integrity (finishing what you start)
- Curiosity (learning how things work)

*Name it. Feel it in your body.*

---

### Part 2: Present Reality Check (Honest Assessment)

**"Right now, in this exact moment, what's actually true about my energy and focus?"**

*Not judging it. Just noticing:*
- Do I feel scattered or focused?
- Am I energised or tired?
- Am I curious or resistant?
- What's my body telling me?

*This information is useful, not shameful.*

---

**"What's pulling my attention away from starting?"**

*Name it without judgment:*
- Fear it won't be perfect?
- Overwhelm at the size of it all?
- Excited about planning more?
- Genuinely low energy?
- Something else calling you?

*Just noticing. Not fixing yet.*

---

**"If I were my own compassionate mentor right now, what would I notice about what I need?"**

*Maybe:*
- A smaller first step?
- Permission to work on what excites you today, not what's "next"?
- Connection to why this matters?
- To move your body first?
- To trust your pace?

*Listen to what emerges.*

---

### Part 3: Permission and Intuition (Activist Mindset)

**"What do I actually *feel like* working on right now?"**

*Not what you "should" do. What genuinely pulls you.*

*This is data, not laziness. Your intuition often knows what you're ready for.*

---

**"Is there a small part of that thing I could explore right now - just for the next 20 minutes - to see how it feels?"**

*What's a tiny, concrete action that would let you taste this work?*

Examples:
- "Open Figma and play with one colour"
- "SSH into the VPS and just look around"
- "Write three sentences about why filtering matters"
- "Read one section of the n8n docs that sounds interesting"
- "Ask Claude one question about the thing I'm curious about"

*Not committing to finishing. Just starting to explore.*

---

**"What if I gave myself permission to work on what energises me today, even if it's 'out of order'?"**

*What would I choose?*

*Reminder: Building momentum matters more than perfect sequence. If you're excited about the theme system but "supposed to" do VPS setup, maybe start with themes. Energy is the scarce resource.*

---

### Part 4: Channel Arousal → Focus (Calming the System)

**"What does my body need right now to feel ready and calm?"**

*Check in:*
- Shake out tension? (30 seconds of movement)
- Three deep breaths?
- Glass of water?
- Stretch?
- Music on or off?
- Different location?

*Do it now. Don't skip this.*

---

**"What's the smallest, most specific next physical action I can take right now?"**

*Not "work on frontend." But:*
- "Open VS Code"
- "Type `git status` in terminal"
- "Create a new FigJam board"
- "Start the timer for 20 minutes"
- "Open the chat template file"

*So small it's almost silly. That's the point.*

---

**"What would make the next 20 minutes feel like play, not work?"**

*How can you structure this to feel more like exploring than obligating?*
- Put on music you love?
- Pretend you're teaching someone?
- Treat it like a puzzle to solve?
- Give yourself permission to stop if it's not engaging?

*Set up the conditions for genuine engagement.*

---

### Part 5: Affirmation and Action (Self-Trust)

**Take a breath. Read these slowly:**

*"I trust my intuition about what I'm ready for today."*

*"Starting small is not thinking small - it's thinking smart."*

*"My energy and attention are valuable. I can spend them where they're most alive."*

*"I'm building a learning system, not just completing tasks. How I work matters as much as what I complete."*

*"20 minutes of engaged work beats 3 hours of forcing. I can always do another 20 minutes after this one."*

*"I'm allowed to enjoy this. In fact, enjoyment is data that I'm in my zone of proximal development."*

*"Whatever I do in the next session - if I'm present and curious - is progress."*

---

### Part 6: Commit to One Thing (Immediate Action)

**"In the next 20 minutes, I will..."**

*Complete this sentence with ONE tiny, concrete action:*

Example:
- "...open the VPS setup chat template and ask one question"
- "...create three colour variables in Figma"
- "...read the n8n webhook documentation and take notes on what confuses me"
- "...update my progress.md with yesterday's reflection"
- "...write the first acceptance criteria for the ticket I'm curious about"

*Write it down. Set a 20-minute timer.*

---

**"After 20 minutes, I will check: Am I engaged? Do I want to continue? Or do I want to stop and celebrate this small win?"**

*Both answers are valid. Trust yourself.*

---

### Closing

**"I'm showing up today with:"**
- My value of [name the value from Part 1]
- Permission to work on [what I'm drawn to]
- Trust in my [intuition/body/timing]
- A tiny next step: [the one thing]

**"That's enough. That's how momentum starts."**

---

## Optional: Mid-Day Reset

If you notice yourself spinning or losing focus:

**Quick Check-In:**
1. What's true right now? (tired? distracted? frustrated?)
2. What do I need? (break? different task? help? food?)
3. What's the tiniest next step that feels aligned?

**Then either:**
- Do the tiny thing, or
- Take the break without guilt

**Both are productive. Both honour your system.**

## Science Behind This Approach

**Motivational Interviewing:**
- Open-ended questions create self-persuasion (more powerful than external pressure)
- Affirmations build self-efficacy
- Reflective questions surface your own motivations

**Activist Mindset:**
- Agency (you choose what to work on)
- Purpose (connected to values, not just tasks)
- Small wins compound into identity change

**Cognitive Science:**
- Specificity beats vagueness ("open VS Code" vs "work on project")
- Emotional engagement predicts follow-through
- Body state affects cognitive state (move → calm → focus)
- Curiosity is more sustainable than discipline

**Arousal Regulation:**
- Name it to tame it (acknowledge what you're feeling)
- Body-first interventions (breath, movement) shift state
- Micro-commitments (20 min) reduce activation threat

## Troubleshooting

**"I went through all the questions and still can't start."**
→ That's data. Open chat template 11 (wellbeing-checkin.md). Something else needs attention first.

**"I realised I want to work on something totally different than planned."**
→ Perfect. Trust that. Work on what energises you. Momentum matters more than sequence.

**"I feel guilty for not following the milestones in order."**
→ The milestones serve you, not the other way around. Building when energised beats forcing when depleted.

**"20 minutes passed and I'm still not engaged."**
→ Celebrate showing up. Stop without guilt. Try again later or tomorrow. Not every day is a building day.

**"I got lost in planning again instead of doing."**
→ Lovely. That's what this project is teaching you about yourself. Try: "For the next 20 minutes, I will not plan. I will only touch one file/one component/one setting." Then set timer.

---

## Remember

**Planning is a form of procrastination when it replaces action.**
But
**Planning from genuine curiosity is action.**

You'll know the difference by how your body feels:
- Genuine curiosity: energised, focused, time passes quickly
- Planning-as-avoidance: scattered, anxious, checking the clock

**Trust yourself to know the difference.**

*This prompt adapts to you. Skip questions that don't land. Add your own. The goal is genuine engagement, not perfect adherence.*
