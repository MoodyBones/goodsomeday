# Writing Practice Program: Voice-First Method

**Created for:** Visual learners who think in systems and get lost between vision and execution  
**Designed by:** Charles Duhigg-style approach to communication  
**Purpose:** Learn to write authentically without perfectionism spirals

---

## The Core Problem This Solves

You're not "bad at writing." You have a gap between:
- **What you know** (clear ideas, strong vision)
- **What ends up on the page** (gets lost in translation)

**Specific friction points:**
- Organizing ideas (they're all jumbled)
- Finding words (ideas clear but language fails)
- Finishing (never feels "done")

**Your strengths:**
- Emotional and social communication (authentic, compassionate, honest)
- Clear vision of desired outcomes
- Visual/structural thinking
- Learning by doing

**What you want:**
- Write your own social content, blog posts, personal reflections
- Use AI for documentation, but write authentic human content yourself
- Build confidence through practice, not perfection

---

## The Philosophy

**Writing has three distinct phases:**

1. **Capture** - Get ideas out of your head
2. **Structure** - Organize the jumble visually
3. **Draft & Edit** - Execute in timed passes

**Most people try to do all three at once. That's why it's hard.**

Like your Goodsomeday approach:
- You don't design the database while typing SQL
- You don't write components while debugging
- You don't plan architecture while deploying

**Same with writing: Separate the phases.**

---

## Phase 1: Voice Capture

**Goal:** Get raw material OUT of your head without judgment

**Time required:** 5-15 minutes

### Method A: Talk First (Recommended)

**Best for:** When ideas feel too big/messy to type

**Process:**
1. Open voice memo app on phone
2. Set 5-minute timer
3. Talk about your topic like explaining to a friend
4. Pretend you're having coffee with someone who gets you
5. Don't script, don't edit yourself, just talk
6. Transcribe using:
   - Whisper API
   - Otter.ai
   - Claude (paste audio or type transcript request)
   - MacOS dictation

**Tips:**
- Stand up or walk while talking (changes energy)
- Start with "So basically..." or "Here's the thing..."
- If you get stuck, say "And another thing is..."
- Talk for the full 5 minutes even if it feels repetitive

### Method B: Bullet Brain Dump

**Best for:** When talking feels weird, or you're in public

**Process:**
1. Open blank document
2. Set 10-minute timer
3. Write bullets - fragments only, not sentences
4. No order, no structure, just GET IT OUT
5. Every thought = one bullet
6. Keep hand moving until timer ends

**Format example:**
```
- daily activation changed everything
- used to freeze at starting
- now have a system
- people use AI wrong - just default prompts
- should customize for their brain
- visual learners need visual tools
- I architect, then use AI to execute
- docs vs authentic writing - different purposes
```

**Tips:**
- Use dashes or asterisks (easier than numbering)
- Abbreviate, use fragments, be messy
- If you write a full sentence, that's fine too
- Write whatever comes, even if it seems random

---

## Phase 2: Structure Detective

**Goal:** Find the natural organization hiding in your captured content

**Time required:** 10-15 minutes

### Step 1: Display Your Content

Print or view your transcript/bullets where you can see everything at once.

### Step 2: Highlight by Type

Use colors (physical highlighters or digital) to categorize:

- 🟡 **YELLOW = Core Message**
  - The ONE thing you want readers to remember
  - Your thesis, main point, key insight
  - Usually 1-2 sentences max

- 🔵 **BLUE = Evidence/Examples**
  - Stories, data, proof points
  - "Here's what happened..."
  - Specific moments, numbers, facts

- 🟢 **GREEN = Feelings/Stakes**
  - Why this matters emotionally
  - How it feels
  - What's at risk
  - "This matters because..."

- 🟣 **PURPLE = Action/Takeaway**
  - What readers can do with this
  - Next steps
  - Invitations
  - "You could try..."

### Step 3: Build Simple Outline

**For emotional/social writing** (your natural style), use this structure:

```markdown
## [TITLE - Question or Statement]

### 1. HOOK
Why should reader care? What feeling/question are we exploring?
[Use: Yellow highlights + Green highlights]

### 2. STORY/CONTEXT
Here's what happened / here's what I learned
[Use: Blue highlights - pick 1-3 best examples]

### 3. INSIGHT
Here's what it means / why it matters
[Use: Yellow highlight + Green highlights]

### 4. INVITATION
What you can do / how this applies to you
[Use: Purple highlights]
```

**Template Example:**

```markdown
## I Used to Think I Was Bad at Writing

### HOOK
For years, I avoided writing. School taught me I was bad at it.
Turns out, I just needed a different process.

### STORY
- Building Goodsomeday, I had clear vision
- Used Claude to write all the docs
- Realized: docs can be automated, but authentic voice can't
- Discovered I'm not bad at writing - I'm bad at traditional writing process

### INSIGHT
There's a difference between architecting and executing.
Visual learners can learn writing, but need visual processes.
Authenticity matters for human content. Automation works for docs.

### INVITATION
If you're using AI to write FOR you, ask: what should YOU write?
Try: capture voice first, structure second, polish third.
Match tools to YOUR learning style, not someone else's process.
```

## Phase 3: First Draft

**Goal:** Get complete draft written without perfectionism

**Time required:** 20 minutes (TIMER MANDATORY)

### Process

**Set 20-minute timer** ⏰

**Follow your outline from Phase 2**

**Write sentences that connect your highlighted pieces**

### Rules

✅ **DO:**
- Write like texting a friend who gets you
- Use "I" statements (emotional/social writing = personal)
- Short sentences are totally fine
- Get to the end even if it's rough
- Trust your outline to guide you
- Write through awkward parts (fix later)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Edit while drafting
- Delete anything (just keep going)
- Reread until timer ends
- Stop to look up perfect words
- Worry about transitions
- Fix typos or grammar

### Tips

- If you get stuck: skip to next outline section
- If you don't like a sentence: write it badly and move on
- If you run out before 20 min: add more examples or feeling
- If timer ends mid-sentence: finish that sentence and STOP

**When timer ends:**

1. Save document
2. Close it
3. Walk away
4. Don't look at it for 2+ hours (or next day)

You now have a complete first draft. It's messy. **That's exactly right.**

---

## Phase 4: Edit Like an Architect

**Goal:** Polish in focused passes, not perfectionism spirals

**Time required:** 25 minutes total

**Wait minimum 2 hours (or next day) before editing**

### Pass 1: Structure Check (5 min)

**Focus:** Big picture only

- Does it follow your outline?
- Is anything in the wrong place?
- Are there gaps in logic?
- Does each section do its job?

**Actions allowed:**
- Cut/move paragraphs
- Add notes like "[need example here]"
- Delete repetitive sections

**Not allowed:**
- Wordsmithing
- Grammar fixes
- Rewriting sentences

### Pass 2: Clarity Check (10 min)

**Focus:** Sentence-level understanding

- Read ALOUD (seriously, out loud)
- If you stumble reading it = simplify it
- If it's confusing = add example or cut it
- If it's boring = add feeling or cut it

**Actions allowed:**
- Simplify complex sentences
- Add examples
- Cut jargon
- Break up long paragraphs

**Not allowed:**
- Searching for "better" words
- Agonizing over punctuation
- Rewriting whole sections

### Pass 3: Voice Check (5 min)

**Focus:** Does it sound like YOU?

Read through asking:
- Would I say this to a friend?
- Does this sound like me?
- Am I trying to sound "smart"?

**Actions allowed:**
- Remove corporate/fake phrases
- Add contractions (I'm, you're, it's)
- Swap formal words for casual ones
- Add personality

**Not allowed:**
- Making it "more professional"
- Second-guessing your authentic voice

### Pass 4: Final Polish (5 min)

**Focus:** Technical cleanup only

- Fix typos
- Check punctuation
- Ensure paragraphs break logically
- Read once more aloud
- **Ship it**

**Total editing time: 25 minutes**

**If you're spending more than 30 minutes editing:**
- You're perfectionism spiraling
- Save current version
- Walk away
- Come back tomorrow and just ship it

---

## When to Use This System

### Use for (write yourself):
- Social media posts (LinkedIn, blog)
- Personal reflections and stories
- Learning journey articles
- Values-driven content
- Anything requiring your authentic voice

### Don't use for (use AI):
- Technical documentation
- API references
- Setup guides
- Changelog entries
- Standardized content

**The rule:** If it needs to sound like YOU, write it. If it needs to be accurate and clear, automate it.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall: "I don't know where to start"
**Solution:** You don't start with writing. Start with Phase 1 (capture). Talk or bullet dump. Structure comes from analyzing, not from staring at blank page.

### Pitfall: "This sounds terrible"
**Solution:** Not a problem in first draft. That's what editing is for. Separate drafting (get it out) from editing (make it good).

### Pitfall: "I keep rewriting the first paragraph"
**Solution:** Timer isn't running or you're editing while drafting. Set 20-min timer. Don't go back. First paragraph gets edited in Phase 4, not during draft.

### Pitfall: "I can't find the right words"
**Solution:** Use wrong words. Write: "[something about feeling stuck]" and keep going. Fix in editing.

### Pitfall: "It's too long/too short"
**Solution:** Not a Phase 3 problem. Length gets adjusted in Phase 4 Pass 1 (structure check).

### Pitfall: "I've been editing for an hour"
**Solution:** Perfectionism spiral. Save version. Walk away. Ship tomorrow without more edits.

## Integration with Daily Activation

**Before writing practice session:**

Use your daily activation prompt to:
1. Check energy level
2. Connect to purpose (why does this writing matter?)
3. Set 20-minute commitment
4. Identify which Phase you're doing today

**Example integration:**
- **Monday:** Phase 1 - Voice capture on [topic]
- **Tuesday:** Phase 2 - Structure the captured content
- **Wednesday:** Phase 3 - First draft (20 min timer)
- **Thursday:** Rest / other work
- **Friday:** Phase 4 - Edit in passes (25 min total)
- **Ship it**

---

## Success Metrics

You're building a practice if:

✅ Writing sessions are time-boxed (not open-ended)
✅ You're finishing pieces (even if imperfect)
✅ You're shipping consistently (weekly or bi-weekly)
✅ Your voice sounds authentic (not trying to impress)
✅ You're less anxious about writing over time
✅ You can point to "I wrote this myself" pieces

You need to adjust if:

❌ Spending 2+ hours on one piece
❌ Never finishing anything
❌ Avoiding writing practice
❌ Everything sounds the same (lost your voice)
❌ Perfectionism is increasing, not decreasing
❌ Writing feels worse, not better

**If adjusting needed:** Return to Phase 1 only for a week. Just practice capturing voice, don't draft. Build confidence in having ideas worth sharing.

# Part 1: Adding Extended Thinking to Your Writing Practice Doc

I'll create an addendum for your `writing-practice-program.md`:

---

## ADDENDUM: Requesting Extended Thinking from Claude

**Add this section after "Activation Prompt for Claude"**

---

### When to Request Extended Thinking

Extended thinking mode shows Claude's reasoning process in `<thinking>` tags before the response. This gives you transparency into HOW the AI is processing your prompt.

**Use extended thinking when:**
- Making complex structural decisions (which outline to use?)
- Evaluating multiple options (Option A vs Option B?)
- Debugging why something isn't working
- Learning a new concept through AI explanation
- Verifying Claude understood your unique needs correctly
- Teaching yourself to prompt better by seeing the reasoning

**Don't need extended thinking for:**
- Simple questions with clear answers
- Creative flow work (can interrupt momentum)
- Quick feedback or encouragement
- Conversational check-ins

---

### How to Request Extended Thinking

**Option 1: At start of session (recommended for complex work)**

Add to your activation prompt:

```
I want to practice my writing using the Voice-First Method. 
I'm working on [topic]. 

Please use extended thinking mode for this session - 
I learn best when I can see your reasoning process.

Let's start with Phase 1 - interview me to capture my voice.
```

**Option 2: For specific decisions**

During a session, say:

```
Show me your thinking on [specific decision/structure/approach]
```

Examples:
- "Show me your thinking on why you chose that outline structure"
- "Show me your thinking on which story angle would work best"
- "Show me your thinking on how to organize these bullet points"

**Option 3: Retroactively**

If Claude already responded, ask:

```
Can you show me the thinking behind that recommendation?
```

---

### What Extended Thinking Looks Like

**Example without extended thinking:**
> "I recommend Option A because it's more emotionally engaging."

**Example with extended thinking:**
```
<thinking>
Looking at the user's bullet points, I see:
- Strong emotional content (trauma, recovery, feelings)
- Natural storytelling voice
- Personal vulnerability is already present
- User said their strength is "emotional and social" conversations

Option A leans into this emotional strength.
Option B is more instructional, which user said they WANT to practice
but haven't built confidence in yet.

Starting with Option A lets them write from strength,
build confidence, then tackle Option B later.

Also noting: user's authentic voice is in the emotional content.
That's where they'll sound most like themselves.
</thinking>

I recommend Option A because it leans into your natural emotional 
storytelling strength, lets you write from authentic voice, 
and you can always write Option B as a follow-up once you've 
built confidence with Option A.
```

### How This Helps Your Learning

**Transparency builds trust:**
- You can verify Claude understood your needs
- You can catch misalignments early
- You can learn what good reasoning looks like

**Improves your prompts:**
- See what information Claude used vs ignored
- Understand what details matter most
- Learn to give better context upfront

**Teaches you to think structurally:**
- See how decisions get made
- Understand trade-offs between options
- Build your own decision-making framework

---

### Integration with Writing Practice

**Recommended approach:**

**Phase 1 (Capture):** Don't need extended thinking
- Just flowing, getting ideas out
- Overthinking blocks creativity

**Phase 2 (Structure):** USE extended thinking
- Complex decision: which structure fits your content?
- Multiple options to evaluate
- Want to understand WHY a structure works

**Phase 3 (Draft):** Don't need extended thinking
- Just writing, timer running
- Momentum matters more than reasoning

**Phase 4 (Edit):** Optional extended thinking
- Use if stuck on major structural edits
- Don't need for polish/grammar

---

### Add to Your Activation Prompt

**Updated activation prompt with thinking option:**

> "I want to practice my writing using the Voice-First Method. I'm working on [topic]. 
> 
> [Include if you want thinking]: Please use extended thinking mode - I learn best when I can see your reasoning process.
> 
> Let's start with Phase 1 - interview me to capture my voice."
