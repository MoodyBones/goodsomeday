I'm on Week 1 of building Goodsomeday (full-stack learning project). I need a weekly summary and planning session.

**Previous work saved in:**
- docs/learning-resources/chat-day1-foundation.md
- docs/learning-resources/chat-day2-vps-setup.md (if exists)
- Linear workspace: https://linear.app/[your-workspace]/team/GOO

**This week's focus:**
- Days 1-3: Foundation (Linear, GitHub, VPS, n8n, PostgreSQL)
- Manual learning - building foundational knowledge

**What I need:**
1. Review what I accomplished this week (I'll tell you)
2. Identify what I learned vs struggled with
3. Preview next week's focus
4. Create learning reflection for docs/learning-journey/

**Format:** Concise, actionable, celebration of wins + honest about challenges.

Here's what I completed this week: [paste your updates]
