I need a well-being check-in for the Goodsomeday learning project.

**Context:**
- Project timeline: 12 days, currently on Day [X]
- Learning intensity: High (new backend concepts)
- Progress saved: docs/learning-resources/

**Current state:**
- Energy level: [High / Medium / Low / Burnt out]
- Motivation: [Excited / Steady / Struggling / Lost]
- Stress level: [Manageable / Moderate / High / Overwhelmed]
- Sleep/health: [Good / Okay / Suffering]

**What's going well:**
[List wins, even tiny ones]

**What's challenging:**
[Be honest - imposter syndrome? Comparison? Time pressure? Confusion? Isolation?]

**Warning signs I'm noticing:**
- [ ] Procrastinating on learning tasks
- [ ] Feeling stupid or "not cut out for this"
- [ ] Comparing myself to others unfavorably
- [ ] Skipping breaks or self-care
- [ ] Losing sight of why I started
- [ ] Perfectionism blocking progress
- [ ] Afraid to ask for help
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**What I need:**
- [ ] Permission to adjust timeline/scope
- [ ] Reframe of what "progress" means
- [ ] Celebration of how far I've come
- [ ] Reminder of learning fundamentals (spaced practice, mistakes are data)
- [ ] Practical strategies for [specific well-being issue]
- [ ] Reality check on expectations
- [ ] Encouragement without toxic positivity

**Specific situation:**
[Describe what's happening, e.g.:]
"I'm on Day 3 and feel behind. Everyone else seems to build full-stack apps in a weekend."

OR

"I've been stuck on this VPS issue for 4 hours and feel incompetent."

**What success looks like:**
I want to finish this project feeling proud AND healthy - not burnt out with a working app.

Help me course-correct toward sustainable learning.
