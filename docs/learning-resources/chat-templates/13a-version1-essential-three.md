# Version 1: "The Essential Three" (Complete All 3)
full version for reference: `docs/learning-resources/chat-templates/13d-full-version.md`
## Time: 2-3 minutes max
1. Connect to What Matters (30 seconds)
"What part of this work actually lights me up right now?"
One sentence. Maybe it's:

The visual design?
Helping others?
Learning something new?
Making it accessible?
Something else?

Name it. Feel it.

2. Trust Your Pull (30 seconds)
"What do I genuinely feel like working on right now - even if it's 'out of order'?"
Your intuition knows what you're ready for.
Permission granted: Work on what energises you today.

3. Make It Tiny (1 minute)
"What's the smallest physical action I can take in the next 20 minutes?"
Not "work on frontend." But:

"Open VS Code"
"Create a Figma frame"
"Type git status"
"Read one doc section"
"Ask Claude one question"

Set 20-minute timer. Start that one tiny thing. Nothing else matters.

After 20 minutes: Am I engaged? Continue or celebrate and stop. Both are wins.
