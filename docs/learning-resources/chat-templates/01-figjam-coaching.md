I'm working on the Goodsomeday project (learning full-stack development) and need coaching on creating a FigJam visual map to review technical concepts from yesterday's conversation.

**Context:**
- Yesterday I set up Linear (20 tickets GOO-6 to GOO-25), GitHub repo, and learned about the tech stack
- Saved conversation: docs/learning-resources/chat-day1-foundation.md
- I want to review Chunks 2, 3, 5 (Tech Stack → Automation Flow → Core Features)

**What I need:**
- Coaching on spatial layout strategies (not you doing it for me)
- Help with dual coding (text + visual) techniques
- Guidance on connection mapping
- Active recall prompts

**My learning style:**
- I learn by DOING, not by having it done for me
- I need you to ASK questions, not give answers
- Coach me through the process step-by-step

**Time available:** [tell it your time]

Let's start with helping me choose a spatial layout for these 3 chunks.
