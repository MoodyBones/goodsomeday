I need help building a frontend component for Goodsomeday.

**Context:**

- Using Claude Code: [Yes/No]

**Component specs:**
[Paste from Linear ticket or describe what you're building]

**What I've tried:**
[Describe your attempts or "Haven't started yet"]

**Specific help needed:**
- [ ] Component architecture/structure
- [ ] TypeScript typing
- [ ] Tailwind styling approach
- [ ] React patterns (hooks, state)
- [ ] Integration with API
- [ ] Debugging specific issue: [describe]

**My approach:**
- I want to understand the pattern, not just copy code
- Explain trade-offs when there are multiple solutions
