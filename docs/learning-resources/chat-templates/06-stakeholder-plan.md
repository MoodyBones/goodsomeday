I need help creating a high-level implementation plan for the Goodsomeday project that I can share with stakeholders (potential users, collaborators, mentors, or interviewers).

**Context:**
- Full project details: docs/learning-resources/chat-day1-foundation.md
- Technical audience: [Technical/Non-technical/Mixed]
- Purpose: [Explain the project / Seek feedback / Request collaboration / Portfolio presentation]
- Time horizon: 12 days (~3 weeks part-time)

**What I need:**
A clear, concise plan that communicates:
1. **What** I'm building (the product)
2. **Why** I'm building it (the learning journey)
3. **How** I'm building it (the approach)
4. **When** key milestones happen (timeline)
5. **What makes it interesting** (unique aspects)

**Stakeholder context:**
- Who I'm presenting to: [describe audience]
- What they care about: [their interests/concerns]
- What I want from them: [feedback / mentorship / collaboration / validation]

**Format preferences:**
- [ ] Executive summary (1 page)
- [ ] Presentation outline (slides structure)
- [ ] Email pitch
- [ ] README-style overview
- [ ] Roadmap visualization (text-based)
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**Tone:**
- [ ] Professional (job interview / formal presentation)
- [ ] Conversational (dev community / blog post)
- [ ] Educational (teaching others)
- [ ] Inspirational (build-in-public / motivational)

Help me create a plan that makes stakeholders say "This is impressive AND well thought out."
