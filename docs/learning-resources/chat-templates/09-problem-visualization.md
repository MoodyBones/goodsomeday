I'm stuck on a technical/conceptual problem in the Goodsomeday project and need help visualizing it.

**Context:**
- Project overview: docs/learning-resources/chat-day1-foundation.md
- Current task: [GOO-XX: Ticket name]
- Tech involved: [Next.js / n8n / PostgreSQL / etc.]

**The problem I'm trying to understand:**
[Describe the concept/problem, e.g.:]
"How does data flow from frontend form → n8n → PostgreSQL and back?"

OR

"I don't understand how React Context works with server components"

OR

"The relationship between n8n workflows and REST APIs is confusing"

**What I've tried:**
- [ ] Read documentation: [what I understood / what's still unclear]
- [ ] Watched tutorials: [what clicked / what didn't]
- [ ] Asked questions: [what I learned / what's still foggy]
- [ ] Drew diagrams: [what I tried to visualize]

**How I learn best:**
- [ ] Analogies and metaphors (compare to something I know)
- [ ] Step-by-step flows (this happens, then this, then this)
- [ ] Visual diagrams (boxes and arrows)
- [ ] Real-world examples (concrete scenarios)
- [ ] Building mental models (frameworks and patterns)
- [ ] Hands-on experimentation (guided exercises)

**What I need:**
Help me build a mental model of [the concept] that I can:
1. Explain to someone else
2. Draw from memory
3. Apply to solve this problem
4. Extend to related problems

**My current understanding (wrong or incomplete is fine):**
[Explain what you THINK is happening - this helps me see where the gap is]

Don't just explain it - help me SEE it.
