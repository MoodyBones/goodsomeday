full version for reference: `docs/learning-resources/chat-templates/13d-full-version.md`
## Time: 30-60 seconds
## Today, which ONE question do I need most?

### Option A: "Why?"
"What part of this work lights me up right now?"
→ If you need connection to purpose, start here.

### Option B: "What?"
"What do I actually feel like working on - even if it's 'wrong'?"
→ If you need permission to follow your energy, start here.

### Option C: "How?"
"What's the tiniest next action I can take right now?"
→ If you know what to do but can't start, start here.

Answer your one question. Set 20-minute timer. Do the tiny thing.
That's it. That's the whole process.
