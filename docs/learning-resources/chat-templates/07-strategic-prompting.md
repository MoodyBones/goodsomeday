I need coaching on strategic prompting for the Goodsomeday project - specifically for Claude Code (development) and Claude API (release notes automation).

**Context:**
- Project: Full-stack learning (Next.js, n8n, PostgreSQL)
- Saved details: docs/learning-resources/chat-day1-foundation.md
- Using Claude Code for: Frontend components (Days 4-12)
- Using Claude API for: Automated release notes (Day 9)

**My current prompting approach:**
[Describe how you currently prompt, or "I haven't started yet"]

**What I need help with:**
1. **Effective prompt structure** for Claude Code
   - How specific should I be?
   - When to reference existing code vs start fresh?
   - How to iterate without starting over?

2. **Context management**
   - What context to include in each prompt?
   - How to reference project patterns/conventions?
   - Managing prompt length vs detail

3. **Common mistakes to avoid**
   - What makes a bad prompt?
   - How to ask for explanations, not just code?

4. **Project-specific examples I need:**
   - [ ] Prompting for React components (e.g., StoryCard)
   - [ ] Prompting for API integration (e.g., useStories hook)
   - [ ] Prompting for n8n workflow logic
   - [ ] Prompting for release notes generation
   - [ ] Prompting for documentation
   - [ ] Other: [specify]

**My learning goal:**
I want to learn how to fish (write effective prompts), not just get fish (working code). Teach me the meta-skill.

**Specific scenario I'm facing:**
[Describe a component/feature you're about to build and want help prompting for]
