**A few years ago, after burnout, I thought coding wasn't for me anymore.**

**This week I:**
- Set up my first VPS
- Configured SSH key authentication
- Hardened server security (firewall, disabled root login)
- Learned Linux properly, not just copy-pasted commands

**The difference? I pair-programmed with Claude.**

It adapted to me being a visual learner and frontend dev. When `usermod` failed, it explained `visudo` without judgment. It drew terminal diagrams for networking concepts. And crucially - it made me test my setup before I could lock myself out. That's the systems thinking I want to build.

I haven't felt this excited about technology in years.

For me, this wasn't just about learning backend. It was discovering a way to learn that prioritizes curiosity and wellbeing over pressure and perfection.

Who else is using AI to match their unique learning style? How are you prioritizing wellbeing in your work?
